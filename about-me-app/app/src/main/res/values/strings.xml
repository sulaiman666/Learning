    \n
    \nI\'am really happy today because finally i can bought Dragon Ball FighterZ (DBFZ), with season 1 pass.
    \n
    \nI buy it on Lunar Steam Sale 2021, that giving me a good deal on the game that i can buy it with
        the season pass 1 only for 10,75 USD (Rp. 150.400,00 in IDR) making it a hell lot cheaper instead
        the prices without the sales which is 67,17 (Rp. 940.000,00 in IDR) USD DAMN that was a really good
        deal so i cant just let it go. Especially when i\'am a Dragonball fanboy so i have no other choices
        but to buy it. When i can buy it why not, right? and i only buy it when it was on a crazy sale like
        this and especially when i know DBFZ community is still active
